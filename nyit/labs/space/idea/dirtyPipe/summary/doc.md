It looks like the `dirtypipezoo/cve-2022-0847` image is no longer available on Docker Hub, which is why you're seeing the "pull access denied" error.

## ‚úÖ Ready-Made Alternatives

### 1. **Use a Vulnerable VM Instead**

Setting up a VM is straightforward and gives you full control over the unpatched kernel:

1. Download a distro with a vulnerable kernel (e.g., **Ubuntu 21.10** with kernel \~5.13).
2. Install it in VirtualBox or QEMU.
3. Disable automatic updates to prevent patching.
4. Compile or download the Dirty Pipe **PoC exploit** (e.g., from Max Kellermann).
5. Run the PoC ‚Äî you'll get successful root escalation or file overwrite ([jfrog.com][1], [securitylabs.datadoghq.com][2]).

This is the most reliable method since you're guaranteed to be on the right kernel.

### 2. **Custom Docker + QEMU Image**

You can build your own test image similar to what `dirtypipezoo` provided:

* Create a **Dockerfile** that sets up a small QEMU VM image using a vulnerable kernel (5.8‚Äì5.15.24).
* Install the exploit PoC inside the VM.
* Run the container with `--privileged` and appropriate QEMU parameters to boot into the unpatched environment.

This method gives you flexibility‚Äîbut it's more work than spinning up a VM.

---

### 3. **Community-Maintained Vulnerability Images**

While the original `dirtypipezoo` image is gone, it's worth checking other community sources or repos such as:

* GitHub searches for `dirty pipe docker image`
* Other security labs or CTF-focused images

‚ö†Ô∏è Always verify kernel version inside these images (must be unpatched: 5.8‚Äì5.15.24) and run locally with `--privileged`.

---

## üß≠ Summary

* ‚úÖ No official Docker Hub image currently available.
* üîß **Best option:** Create a small vulnerable **VM** with kernel ‚â§‚ÄØ5.15.24 and test freely.
* üõ†Ô∏è Advanced users: build your own Docker+QEMU image with a vulnerable kernel and PoC preloaded.
