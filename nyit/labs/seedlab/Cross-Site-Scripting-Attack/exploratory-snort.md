# Find `snort` rules for XSS attack

## Pre-requirement

Install `snort` on Ubuntu 16.04 (VM provided by seed-project) as

```
sudo apt install snort
```

Edit `/etc/snort/snort.conf` using `sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf`:

```conf
# ipvar HOME_NET any
ipvar HOME_NET 10.0.2.0/16
```

Compose all rules in file `/etc/snort/rules/local.rules`

```
sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```

Then run it with

```
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp0s3
```

Now, the IP address of the testing VM is set as `10.0.2.15/16`.

## Built-in rules about XSS

search the folder `/etc/snort/rules/` in local by keyword `"XSS"`:

```
egrep "XSS" /etc/snort/rules/*.rules
```

Results ([`XSS_lookup.txt`](./XSS_lookup.txt)):

## TCP/UDP traffic on non-standard ports

Assume we want to issue warnings upon finding any TCP/UDP traffics on ports expect on own 22/23/80/443 ports:

```
alert tcp any any <> 10.0.2.15 ![22,23,80,443] (msg: "communicate on special ports";sid:1000001; rev:1;)
alert udp any any <> 10.0.2.15 ![22,23,80,443] (msg: "communicate on special ports";sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```

Try to ping its port 4000 from VM `10.0.2.4`

```
nc -vz 10.0.2.15 4000
```

It alerts as expected:

## Some `pcre` cheatsheet \*

UTF-8 | URL| 
---------|----------
`<` | `%3C`
`/` | `%2F`
`>` | `%3E`
`#` | `%23`
`'` | `%27`
`=` | `%3D`

`pcre` should be written in `/regex/[modifier]`, the modifier includes `i` (case insensitive), `x` (ignore spaces in regex).

More details can be found in [references](#references):

## SQL Inject

All snort rules are verified on Ubuntu 12.04 (see [its install and use guide](../Heartbleed-Attack/README.MD#detect-the-attack-with-snort)) VM (`10.0.2.6`) as Version 2.9.2 IPv6 GRE. *Somehow, the results cannot be reproduced on Ubuntu 16.04, perhaps snort is installed improperly on it, we temporarily leave the issue in to-do list*

For example, we do SQL inject attack like [task 2.1](../SQL-Injection-Attack/readme.md#task-21) using `Admin' #` as username, which means we should send such an HTTP GET request:

![](../SQL-Injection-Attack/http_get.png)

It's significant and valid component is `#` (URL encode: `%23`) right after `'` (URL encode `%27`) to make the following SQL clauses as comments.



```sh
alert tcp any any -> 10.0.2.4 80 \ 
# specify the server ip and http/https port in your machine
(msg: "SQL inject GET"; \
flow:to_server,established; \
content: "GET";  nocase; http_method;\ 
#check if its method is GET
content: "php?"; nocase; http_uri; \ 
#the web script is written in php so it will be a suffix in request uri
content: "username="; nocase; http_uri; pcre:"/(\%27).*(\%23)/ix"; \ 
# inject in field "username", check if there is any "' #" pattern in it
classtype:web-application-attack; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
```


When we use `Admin' #` log in the website from VM `10.0.2.6` it will alert:

![](../SQL-Injection-Attack/snort_succ_1.png)

If you don't know any username but want to do SQL injection, you might use such a username

```
xxx' OR 1=1 # 
```

![](../SQL-Injection-Attack/always_true.png)

The pattern `' OR \w*=\w* #` is a critical signal in such attacks.

```sh
alert tcp any any -> 10.0.2.4 80 \ 
# specify the server ip and http/https port in your machine
(msg: "SQL inject GET alter"; \
flow:to_server,established; \
content: "GET";  nocase; http_method;\ 
#check if its method is GET
content: "php?"; nocase; http_uri; \ 
#the web script is written in php so it will be a suffix in request uri
content: "username="; nocase; http_uri; pcre:"/(\%27).*OR.*\w*(\%3D)\w*(\%23)/ix"; \ 
# inject in field "username", check if there is any "' #" pattern and short-circuiting in it
classtype:web-application-attack; sid:1000004; rev:1;)
```

Not surprisingly, when typing `a' OR 1=1` as injected username, both 2 rules will be triggered:

![](../SQL-Injection-Attack/snort_succ_2.png)

It is a special case within the scenes that the former rule describes.

In [task 3.2](../SQL-Injection-Attack/readme.md#task-32), we inject with `', salary=1000000 #` to update the `salary` record which is not mutable in edit profile page. It's done by sending an HTTP GET request as:

![](../SQL-Injection-Attack/set_http_get.png)

Its remarkable feature is `'` followed by `,` (URL encode `%2C`) , `=` (URL encode `%3D`), and `#`.

```sh
alert tcp any any -> 10.0.2.4 80 \ 
# specify the server ip and http/https port in your machine
(msg: "SQL inject set properties"; \
flow:to_server,established; \
content: "GET";  nocase; http_method;\ 
#check if its method is GET
content: "php?"; nocase; http_uri; \ 
#the web script is written in php so it will be a suffix in request uri
content: "phonenumber="; nocase; http_uri; pcre:"/(\%27).* (\%2C).*\w*(\%3D)\w*.*(\%23)/ix"; \ 
# inject in field "phonenumber", check if there is any "', xxx=xxx #" pattern.
classtype:web-application-attack; sid:1000005; rev:1;)
```

It can detect if any `', xxx=xxx #` is filled in **Phone Number** field.

![](./../SQL-Injection-Attack/snort_succ_3.png)

## XSS

We decide to detect if a user is going to write some malicious executable `js` code in his/her profile. Editing profile is usually implemented by sent an HTTP POST request to the server. For example, we edit the profile page as [Task 1](./readme.md#task-1) in Cross-Site Scripting Attack Lab, it will send a packet like:

![](./packet.png)

"signature" for this kind of message is

```
<script> ... </script>
```

Or

```
<script type="text/javascript"> ... </script>
```

In `description` or `briefdescription` field in the request.

In a word, `<script ...>` and `</script>` are suspicious keywords. The URL encoding formats of the mentioned special characters:



To detect those suspicious payloads, we write the following rule based on [built-in rules](#built-in-rules-about-xss) in  `/etc/snort/rules/community-web-php.rules`:

```sh
alert tcp any any -> 10.0.2.4 80 \ 
# specify the server ip and http/https port in your machine
(msg: "suspicious XSS: script in describe"; \
flow:to_server,established; \
content: "POST";  nocase; http_method;\ 
#check if its method is POST
content: "description="; nocase; http_client_body; pcre: "/(\%3C)(\%2F)?script.*(\%3E)/ix"; \ 
# inject in field "description", check if there is any "<(/)script ...>" pattern.
classtype:web-application-attack; sid:1000006; rev:1;)
```

When submitting the modification of profile like [Task 1](./readme.md#task-1), snort works:

![](./snort_succ.png)

And when we attempt to edit description like [Task 6](./readme.md#task-6), it also can be detected by the rule.


**Note**: it is a simple demo for the simplest and highly-specified models of SQL inject and XSS attack, a bunch of adjustments should be applied based on domain in the real world, in which both attacks and servers are much more complex and flexible.
