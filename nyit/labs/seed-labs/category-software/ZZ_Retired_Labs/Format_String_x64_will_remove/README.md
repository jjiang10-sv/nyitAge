# Format String Lab (64-bit)


This is a new lab based on the 32-bit format string lab. 
In this lab, we compile the target vulnerable program 
into 64-bit binary. The attack is a little bit more difficult.
Moreover, we use Docker to set up the lab environment.
The attacker will use the VM to launch attacks, while the 
vulnerable server runs inside a container.
