# Format String Lab

Updated message on 4/4/2024:
The lab description is updated for the ARM. The ARM
platform does not support 32-bit, so students using 
Apple Silicon machines will use 64-bit server program 
for all the tasks.


Original message: 
This is a newly developed lab. It merges the 32-bit 
and 64-bit versions together into one lab. 
The majority of the tasks are on 32-bit programs,
because it is easier. The last task is on 64-bit programs.
This task is significantly more difficult, so if 
instructors do not want to include this task, they can
make it optional.
