# About this lab

This is the server version of the buffer-overflow attack lab.
There is also a setuid version. Both labs cover 32-bit and 64-bit.

## Update on December 2023

We decide to provide an arm64 version of this lab. Because the 
changes are quite significant, it is hard to use one lab
description to fit both. We will create two separate lab description.
To minimize the duplication, we decide to split the one single
tex file into multiple files, so common sections can be shared.
