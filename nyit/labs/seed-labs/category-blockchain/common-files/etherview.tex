We have implemented a simple web application called \texttt{EtherView} to
display the activities on the Blockchain. To access the application,
point your browser (within the VM) to \url{http://localhost:5000/}.
From the \texttt{Blocks} page, you can see the newly created blocks and 
recent transactions. If nobody is sending transactions, the 
blocks are mostly empty, i.e., containing no transactions. Once we 
start sending transactions, we should be able to see them. 
Users can click on the blocks and transactions to see their details.
