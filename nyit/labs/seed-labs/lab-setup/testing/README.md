# Testing

We are developing automatic testings to
test newly created lab environments. The goal is to 
find out whether they any lab will break. Here are the 
requirements of the testing.

- The testing should be automatic, the interpretation
  of the testing results can be partially manual. 

- The testing should not reveal the lab solution. This 
  is because the testing tool will be public.
