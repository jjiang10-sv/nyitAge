computer architecture :
    CPU is mostly made of sand and processed into chips. it process the instructure by cycles, runs very fast 10^9 times 
per seconds. the performance is measured by the number of instructure processed per sond. registry pipelines , 
load and write into memory. If/jump/alogirum instructuion went through different stages.
