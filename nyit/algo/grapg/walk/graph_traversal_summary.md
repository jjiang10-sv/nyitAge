# Stacks and Queues in Graph BFS and DFS

## Overview

Graph traversal algorithms use different data structures to control the order in which nodes are visited:

- **Stack (LIFO)** → **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Queue (FIFO)** → **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

## 1. Data Structure Fundamentals

### Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
```
Operations:
- push(item): Add to top
- pop(): Remove from top
- peek(): View top without removing

Example: [1, 2, 3] → push(4) → [1, 2, 3, 4] → pop() → [1, 2, 3]
```

### Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
```
Operations:
- enqueue(item): Add to back
- dequeue(): Remove from front
- peek(): View front without removing

Example: [1, 2, 3] → enqueue(4) → [1, 2, 3, 4] → dequeue() → [2, 3, 4]
```

## 2. Depth-First Search (DFS) with Stack

### How DFS Works
1. Start with a node and push it onto the stack
2. While stack is not empty:
   - Pop the top node from stack
   - Process the node
   - Push all unvisited neighbors onto the stack
3. Continue until stack is empty

### Key Characteristics
- **Exploration Strategy**: Goes deep into one path before backtracking
- **Memory Usage**: O(V) where V is number of vertices
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where E is number of edges
- **Use Cases**: Path finding, cycle detection, topological sort

### Example Traversal
```
Graph:
    1 -- 2 -- 3
    |    |    |
    4 -- 5 -- 6
    |    |    |
    7 -- 8 -- 9

DFS with Stack (starting from 1):
Stack: [1]
Pop 1, push neighbors: [4, 2]
Pop 2, push neighbors: [4, 5, 3]
Pop 3, push neighbors: [4, 5, 6]
Pop 6, push neighbors: [4, 5, 9]
... continues until all nodes visited

Result: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```

## 3. Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Queue

### How BFS Works
1. Start with a node and enqueue it
2. While queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue the front node
   - Process the node
   - Enqueue all unvisited neighbors
3. Continue until queue is empty

### Key Characteristics
- **Exploration Strategy**: Explores all neighbors at current level before moving deeper
- **Memory Usage**: O(V) where V is number of vertices
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where E is number of edges
- **Use Cases**: Shortest path finding, level-order traversal, web crawling

### Example Traversal
```
Same Graph:
    1 -- 2 -- 3
    |    |    |
    4 -- 5 -- 6
    |    |    |
    7 -- 8 -- 9

BFS with Queue (starting from 1):
Queue: [1]
Dequeue 1, enqueue neighbors: [2, 4]
Dequeue 2, enqueue neighbors: [4, 3, 5]
Dequeue 4, enqueue neighbors: [3, 5, 7]
... continues level by level

Result: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9]
```

## 4. Comparison: DFS vs BFS

| Aspect | DFS (Stack) | BFS (Queue) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Data Structure** | Stack (LIFO) | Queue (FIFO) |
| **Exploration** | Deep first | Level by level |
| **Memory** | O(V) | O(V) |
| **Time** | O(V + E) | O(V + E) |
| **Shortest Path** | Not guaranteed | Guaranteed |
| **Use Cases** | Path finding, cycles | Shortest path, levels |

### Python Implementation
```python
# DFS with Stack
def dfs_stack(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    result = []
    
    while stack:
        current = stack.pop()  # LIFO
        if current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            result.append(current)
            # Push neighbors in reverse order
            for neighbor in reversed(graph[current]):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)
    return result

# BFS with Queue
from collections import deque

def bfs_queue(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    result = []
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()  # FIFO
        if current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            result.append(current)
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    return result
```

### Go Implementation
```go
// DFS with Stack
func dfsStack(graph map[int][]int, start int) []int {
    visited := make(map[int]bool)
    stack := list.New()
    result := []int{}
    
    stack.PushBack(start)
    
    for stack.Len() > 0 {
        current := stack.Remove(stack.Back()).(int)  // LIFO
        if !visited[current] {
            visited[current] = true
            result = append(result, current)
            
            // Push neighbors in reverse order
            neighbors := graph[current]
            for i := len(neighbors) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
                if !visited[neighbors[i]] {
                    stack.PushBack(neighbors[i])
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

// BFS with Queue
func bfsQueue(graph map[int][]int, start int) []int {
    visited := make(map[int]bool)
    queue := list.New()
    result := []int{}
    
    queue.PushBack(start)
    
    for queue.Len() > 0 {
        current := queue.Remove(queue.Front()).(int)  // FIFO
        if !visited[current] {
            visited[current] = true
            result = append(result, current)
            
            for _, neighbor := range graph[current] {
                if !visited[neighbor] {
                    queue.PushBack(neighbor)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

## 7. Advanced Applications

### Path Finding
- **DFS**: Finds any path (not necessarily shortest)
- **BFS**: Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs

### Cycle Detection
- **DFS**: Efficient for detecting cycles using recursion stack
- **BFS**: Can detect cycles but less efficient

### Topological Sort
- **DFS**: Natural fit for topological sorting
- **BFS**: Kahn's algorithm uses queue (in-degree based)

### Connected Components
- **DFS**: Efficient for finding all connected components
- **BFS**: Can also find components but DFS is more common

## 8. Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Both algorithms use O(V) space for visited tracking
- Stack/Queue can grow to O(V) in worst case
- DFS recursion stack can cause stack overflow for deep graphs

### Time Complexity
- Both are O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- BFS is often faster for finding shortest paths
- DFS is often faster for deep exploration

### When to Use Which?

**Use DFS when:**
- You need to explore deep paths
- Memory is limited (recursive DFS can be optimized)
- You're looking for any path, not shortest
- You need to detect cycles or do topological sort

**Use BFS when:**
- You need shortest path in unweighted graphs
- You want level-by-level exploration
- You're doing web crawling or social network analysis
- You need to find nodes at specific distances

## 9. Real-World Examples

### Social Networks
- **DFS**: Finding friend connections, detecting cycles in relationships
- **BFS**: Suggesting friends, finding people at specific distances

### Web Crawling
- **DFS**: Deep crawling of specific websites
- **BFS**: Level-by-level crawling, finding pages at specific depths

### Game AI
- **DFS**: Exploring game trees, finding winning strategies
- **BFS**: Finding shortest path to goal, level-based game progression

### Network Routing
- **DFS**: Finding any route between nodes
- **BFS**: Finding shortest route in unweighted networks

## 10. Summary

The choice between stack (DFS) and queue (BFS) fundamentally changes how a graph is explored:

- **Stack → DFS**: Deep exploration, good for path finding and cycle detection
- **Queue → BFS**: Level-by-level exploration, good for shortest paths and level-based processing

Both algorithms are fundamental building blocks for graph algorithms and are used extensively in computer science applications.
