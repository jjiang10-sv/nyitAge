Yes, all logarithms are scalar multiples of each other due to the change of base formula. The formula states:

￼

Here’s why this implies that all logarithms are scalar multiples:

	1.	Different Bases, Same Relationship: For any logarithms with different bases ￼ and ￼, the logarithm in base ￼ can be expressed as a scaled version of the logarithm in base ￼. The scaling factor is the constant ￼, which depends only on the relationship between the two bases.
	2.	Example: If you consider logarithms in base 10 (￼) and natural logarithms (￼, or ￼), they are related as:
￼
Thus, ￼ is simply a scalar multiple of ￼, with the scalar being ￼.

This scaling property ensures that all logarithms share the same fundamental behavior but differ by a constant factor depending on their base.
