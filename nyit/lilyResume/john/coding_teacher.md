Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am excited to apply for the LEGO and Coding Instructor position at Robokids Coquitlam Campus. With over a decade of experience in software development and a passion for mentoring future technologists, I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and leadership skills to inspire young learners in STEM.  

### **Why I’m a Strong Fit**  
- **Technical Proficiency:** My background in programming (Python, Go, DevOps, and cloud platforms) equips me to teach coding fundamentals in an engaging, age-appropriate manner. At Tesla, I designed IoT systems and deployed machine learning models, skills directly applicable to robotics and automation concepts.  
- **Leadership & Mentorship:** As a Dev Team Leader at Kyligence and PwC, I trained junior developers and streamlined cross-team collaboration. I thrive in roles that require breaking down complex ideas into digestible lessons, a critical skill for teaching children.  
- **Creativity & Adaptability:** At Citibank, I automated data analytics workflows, demonstrating problem-solving skills that align with fostering creativity in students. I also led agile projects, ensuring deliverables met deadlines—a mindset I’ll bring to classroom activities.  

### **Passion for STEM Education**  
While my resume highlights corporate achievements, my true passion lies in empowering others through technology. During my Master’s in Cybersecurity, I’ve explored cryptography and network security, topics I’d love to simplify for young minds. Robotics and coding are gateways to critical thinking, and I am committed to making these subjects accessible and fun.  

### **Availability**  
- **Schedule:** Fully available for Tuesday–Friday, 4:00–7:00 PM.  
- **Start Date:** Ready to begin on March 27, 2025.  

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Robokids’ mission of nurturing curiosity and innovation in students. My technical background, coupled with my enthusiasm for education, positions me to create a dynamic learning environment where children can thrive.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can support your team and inspire the next generation of STEM leaders.  

Sincerely,
