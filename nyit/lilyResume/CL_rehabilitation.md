**Hiring Manager**  
Fraser Health – Fellburn Care Centre  
Burnaby, BC  

**Dear Hiring Manager,**  

I am excited to apply for the **Rehabilitation Assistant** position at Fellburn Care Centre, as advertised. With over 15 years of hands-on experience in rehabilitative care, trauma-informed support, and interdisciplinary collaboration, I am eager to contribute my skills to Fraser Health’s mission of enhancing quality of life for long-term care residents. My background aligns closely with the role’s focus on mobility exercises, activities of daily living (ADL) assistance, and patient-centered care, and I am confident in my ability to deliver compassionate, efficient support to your team and residents.  

In my role as a **Medical Coordinator** at Baobei Foundation, I coordinated post-operative rehabilitation plans for children with congenital defects, including mobility exercises, positioning, and the use of adaptive devices such as braces and wheelchairs. I collaborated closely with healthcare teams to optimize care outcomes and trained caregivers in trauma-informed techniques for ADL support, hygiene, and medication administration. My experience also includes documenting patient progress, reporting behavioral changes to multidisciplinary teams, and managing high-pressure environments—skills I am ready to apply to support residents at Fellburn Care Centre.  

Additionally, as a **Special Education Teacher**, I supported children with cerebral palsy through personalized ADL assistance, including grooming, feeding, and mobility transfers. I designed therapeutic activities to improve motor skills and partnered with therapists and parents to adjust care strategies—a testament to my collaborative approach and commitment to holistic care. My administrative experience further strengthens my ability to maintain accurate records, manage equipment inventories, and streamline documentation processes, ensuring compliance with Fraser Health’s standards.  

I hold certifications in **CPR/First Aid (Level C equivalent)**, **Trauma-Informed Care**, and **Non-Violent Crisis Intervention (NVCI)**, with renewal in progress. My physical stamina, honed through years of assisting with lifts, transfers, and prolonged care tasks, aligns with the role’s demands. I am also fluent in Mandarin and English, which allows me to connect with diverse populations and advocate effectively for residents’ needs.  

Fraser Health’s values of innovation, collaboration, and community-focused care deeply resonate with me. I am particularly drawn to your emphasis on professional development and employee well-being, including benefits portability and pension enrollment—a commitment I am eager to reciprocate through dedicated service.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and passion for rehabilitative care can benefit your team. Thank you for considering my application. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview and can be reached at 672-965-9955 or lilybaobei2012@yahoo.com.  

Sincerely,  
**Lily Rong**
