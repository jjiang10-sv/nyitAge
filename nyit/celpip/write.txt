Dear Customer Support Manager,

My name is John and worksI work for a real stateestate company called SafeHome. My company has purchased an online document translation service from your website but had a bad experience recently when I used it to translate an important business document for the our business partners. theThe document hascontained guidelines on the different roles for each of the business partners to play in an incoming project, and I have submitted the original document yesterday.

The online translation service has made several errors when translating from English to MadarineMandarin and French, such as missing the specific project kick-off date in the original document and messesmessing up the syntax in the translated MadarineMandarin and French. When the business partners read the translated documents, they could not fully understand what the document intendsintended to inform them about regarding the project roles and deadlines, have. We had to delay the project and make extra calls/emails in order to clarify everything and sync up with each other.

I have attached a detailed report on the errors it has made for your reference and adviceadvise you to train this servicesservice with more samples and languages. Also, my company is not happy about the project delay that the transaltiontranslation service has directly caused and would like to request a monetary compensation of around CAD 1K from your side, as we paid a high subscription fee for the service but the delivery quality iswas below thewhat was promised in the commercial contract.

Best Regards,
John


Dear Customer Support Manager,
I am writing regarding a recent issue with your translation service that I used for an important business document. As a representative of SafeHome Real Estate, I submitted guidelines outlining partner roles for an upcoming project yesterday, requesting translation from English to Mandarin and French.
Unfortunately, the translated documents contained several critical errors that significantly impacted our business operations. The project kick-off date was completely omitted, and both the Mandarin and French versions contained numerous syntax errors that altered the meaning of our instructions. As a result, our international partners misinterpreted their responsibilities, forcing us to delay the project launch and spend additional time clarifying the confusion through multiple calls and emails.
I have attached a detailed error report for your review. Given that we pay a premium subscription fee for your services, we expect accuracy that meets the standards promised in our contract. We request compensation of CAD 1,000 for the delays and inconvenience caused.
I would also suggest implementing more rigorous quality checks and expanding your language training samples to prevent similar issues in the future.
Sincerely,
John
