**A**:  
- **RAM Slack**: Unused space between the end of a file and the end of the sector.  
- **File Slack**: Unused sectors in the last cluster occupied by a file.  

---

#### **5. Order of Volatility**

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introduction to Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) is the cornerstone of investigating cyber incidents. It encompasses the tools, roles, processes, and methods needed to collect, analyze, and preserve digital evidence in a way that is both legally sound and technically robust.

---

## üîç What is DFIR?

At its core, **Digital Forensics** involves uncovering and interpreting electronic data to answer questions like who, what, when, where, why, and how. **Incident Response (IR)** is the structured approach to detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

---

## üìÇ The Digital Forensics Process

1. **Acquisition**: Identify and collect data from a variety of sources (e.g., hard drives, memory).
2. **Examination & Analysis**: Interpret the data using specialized tools.
3. **Reporting**: Document findings in a clear, reproducible way.

This process is backed by international standards like ISO/IEC 27043.

---

## üß≠ The Incident Response Lifecycle

1. **Preparation**: Equip and train the team.
2. **Identification**: Detect incidents and assess scope.
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems and operations.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Review and improve.

---

## üíΩ Understanding Data and Storage

* **File Systems**: Define how data is stored (e.g., NTFS, APFS, FAT32).
* **Sectors & Clusters**: Smallest units of disk storage.
* **Slack Space**: Unused data segments that may still hold forensic value.
* **RAM**: Volatile memory, rich in real-time data like passwords or clipboard contents.

---

## üî¢ Number Systems in Forensics

Understanding binary, hexadecimal, and decimal systems is vital for interpreting raw data:

* 8 bits = 1 byte = 2 nibbles
* 1 byte in binary (e.g., `00101011`) = `0x2B` in hex

---

## üìÅ Digital Evidence & Metadata

* **Data**: The actual content (e.g., files).
* **Metadata**: Data about the data (e.g., file creation date, author).
* Tools like **ExifTool** help reveal hidden metadata.
* A file‚Äôs extension might lie‚Äîits **magic header** reveals its true type.
