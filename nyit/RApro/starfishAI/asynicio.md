The `run_in_event_loop` function is designed to execute an asynchronous coroutine within an event loop in Python. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Function Definition**: The function takes a single argument, `coroutine`, which is expected to be an asynchronous function.

2. **Try Block**: 
   - The function first attempts to get the currently running event loop using `asyncio.get_running_loop()`. If there is no event loop running, this will raise a `RuntimeError`.
   - If an event loop is found, it applies `nest_asyncio.apply()`, which allows the current event loop to be patched so that it can run nested event loops. This is useful in environments like Jupyter notebooks where an event loop might already be running.

3. **Running the Coroutine**: If the above steps succeed, it uses `asyncio.run(coroutine)` to execute the provided coroutine within the current event loop.

4. **Exception Handling**: If a `RuntimeError` is raised (indicating that no event loop is currently running), the function catches this exception and simply passes, allowing the code to continue to the next step.

5. **Fallback Execution**: After the try-except block, the function calls `asyncio.run(coroutine)` again. This is the fallback mechanism that will create a new event loop and run the coroutine if no existing loop was found.

### Summary
In essence, `run_in_event_loop` is a utility function that ensures a coroutine can be executed in an appropriate event loop context, whether one is already running or not. It handles both scenarios gracefully, making it versatile for different execution environments.

To create and run an event loop in Python using the `asyncio` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Import the asyncio module**: Ensure you have the `asyncio` module imported in your script.

2. **Define an asynchronous function (coroutine)**: This is the function that you want to run within the event loop.

3. **Create an event loop**: You can create a new event loop using `asyncio.new_event_loop()`.

4. **Set the event loop**: Use `asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)` to set the newly created loop as the current event loop.

5. **Run the coroutine**: Use `loop.run_until_complete(coroutine())` to run your coroutine until it completes.

6. **Close the loop**: After the coroutine has finished executing, you should close the loop using `loop.close()`.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this:

```python
import asyncio

# Step 2: Define an asynchronous function (coroutine)
async def my_coroutine():
    print("Coroutine is running...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an asynchronous operation
    print("Coroutine has finished.")

# Step 3: Create an event loop
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()

# Step 4: Set the event loop
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)

# Step 5: Run the coroutine
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(my_coroutine())
finally:
    # Step 6: Close the loop
    loop.close()
```

### Explanation of the Example:
- The `my_coroutine` function is defined as an asynchronous function that prints messages and simulates a delay using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
- A new event loop is created and set as the current loop.
- The coroutine is executed using `loop.run_until_complete()`, which blocks until the coroutine is done.
- Finally, the event loop is closed to free up resources.

This is how you can create and run an event loop in Python using `asyncio`.
