Added dx="578" dy="389" grid="1" gridSize="10" in <mxGraphModel>

This ensures proper rendering of the diagram.

Ensured as="geometry" is present in all <mxGeometry> elements

This prevents missing shapes.

Fixed incorrect <mxGeometry> nesting inside edges

Edge connections should not have their own <mxGeometry>.

analyse the code below and generate drawio diagram on create_dataset_files with dx = "578" dy = "389" grid="1" gridSize="10" in <mxGraphModel>
Edge connections should not have their own <mxGeometry> Ensured as="geometry" is present in all <mxGeometry> elements
