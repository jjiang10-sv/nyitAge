## 📦 What Can It Extract?

Depending on the device and model, Cellebrite tools can extract:

* **Contacts**
* **Call logs**
* **SMS/MMS**
* **Chat messages** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal metadata, etc.)
* **Emails**
* **Photos and videos**
* **Location history / GPS**
* **Internet browsing history**
* **App data** (e.g., Uber, Instagram, Tinder, banking apps)
* **Wi-Fi connections**
* **Deleted content** (if not securely wiped)

> 🔐 In many cases, even if the device is locked, Cellebrite can exploit vulnerabilities to gain access — especially on outdated or unpatched devices.

---

## ⚠️ Legal and Ethical Issues

Cellebrite’s technology is **controversial** due to:

* **Privacy concerns**: Used to extract private citizen data
* **Authoritarian regimes**: Reports of use by governments with poor human rights records
* **Bypassing encryption**: Tools that bypass device security raise ethical questions
* **Exploitation of 0-day vulnerabilities**: May involve undisclosed OS exploits

Let me know if you'd like:

* A breakdown of how UFED works
* Comparison with Magnet AXIOM or GrayKey
* Insights on bypassing iOS/Android locks using forensic tools


Here's a detailed breakdown of how **UFED (Universal Forensic Extraction Device)** by Cellebrite works — from physical connection to final evidence reporting.

---

## 🧠 What Is UFED?

**UFED** is Cellebrite’s flagship product used for **extracting, decoding, and analyzing data** from mobile phones and other digital devices. It supports iOS, Android, feature phones, GPS units, tablets, and some IoT devices.

It comes in both:

* 🧰 **Hardware** (portable, rugged devices used by field agents)
* 💻 **Software** (used on forensic workstations)

---

## 🧬 Breakdown of UFED Workflow

### 🔌 1. **Device Identification & Connection**

* Connect the suspect’s device via USB or supported cable.
* UFED detects device **make, model, OS version**, and whether it is **locked, encrypted, or jailbroken/rooted**.
* It attempts to match the device against a database of supported extraction profiles.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Device detected: iPhone 11, iOS 14.6, locked
UFED method: Advanced Logical + iTunes Backup fallback
```

---

### 🧪 2. **Determine Extraction Method**

UFED chooses the best possible data extraction method based on the device and lock/encryption status:

| Extraction Type        | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Logical**          | Extracts user-accessible data (calls, texts, photos, etc.) via OS APIs                   |
| 🔍 **File System**     | Extracts file system, including hidden folders and databases                             |
| 💾 **Physical**        | Bit-by-bit copy of device memory (only for some devices)                                 |
| 🔧 **Advanced/Custom** | Uses zero-day exploits or bootloader vulnerabilities to bypass security and extract data |

---

### 🔐 3. **Bypass Locks and Encryption (If Needed)**

* If the device is locked and not encrypted (or encryption can be bypassed), UFED may use:

  * OS-specific exploits
  * Bootloader manipulation
  * Custom recovery modes
  * Jailbreaking/rooting scripts

⚠️ **Not all phones can be unlocked.** Cellebrite Premium (an advanced add-on) is needed for devices like newer iPhones and Samsung models.

---

### 📥 4. **Data Extraction**

Once access is gained, UFED proceeds to extract:

* Contacts, call logs
* SMS/MMS
* App data (WhatsApp, Signal metadata, Instagram, etc.)
* Photos/videos, including deleted or hidden ones
* Web history and bookmarks
* GPS/location data
* Calendar, notes, files
* System logs
* Hidden databases and caches

🗑️ **Deleted data recovery**: If physical extraction is possible, it may recover deleted messages, photos, and even file fragments.

---

### 📊 5. **Data Parsing and Decoding**

Raw data is often encoded, encrypted, or structured in proprietary formats.

UFED works with **Cellebrite Physical Analyzer** or integrated software to:

* Decode SQLite databases (used by iOS and Android apps)
* Convert timestamps to human-readable format
* Parse proprietary app formats (e.g., Snapchat chat logs)
* Rebuild conversations or activity timelines

---

### 🕵️ 6. **Analysis and Tagging**

With the data now extracted and parsed:

* Investigators can search, filter, and tag messages or media
* Build timelines (e.g., “where was this device on May 10 at 3:00 PM?”)
* Visualize social graphs (who spoke to whom, when, and how often)
* Flag risky content (e.g., explicit images, terror-related words)

---

### 📁 7. **Evidence Report Generation**

Cellebrite can generate **court-admissible reports** in:

* PDF
* HTML
* Excel
* Cellebrite Reader (free viewer software)

Reports include:

* Hash verification (MD5/SHA256) to prove evidence integrity
* Chain-of-custody info
* Search keywords and filters
* Screenshots and media previews

---

## 🔐 Example Extraction Scenarios

| Scenario                             | Result                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unlocked Android phone**           | Full file system, including WhatsApp DB                     |
| **Locked iPhone 12 (iOS 16.2)**      | May require Cellebrite Premium or fallback to iCloud backup |
| **Old Nokia phone**                  | Full binary dump (physical) possible                        |
| **Encrypted Samsung phone with FRP** | May require bypass using EDL mode or bootloader exploit     |

---

## 🔍 Key Notes

* ⚖️ **All actions must follow legal warrants and protocols.**
* 📶 Some methods can be destructive or detectable (e.g., jailbreaks).
* 🔒 Not all phones can be cracked — especially modern encrypted Androids/iPhones.
* 🧠 Some data (e.g., Signal messages) may be inaccessible if encrypted securely.

## 🧪 Walkthrough: Sample UFED Extraction (Android Device)

Let’s say an investigator receives a **Samsung Galaxy S10** running **Android 10**. It’s **PIN-locked**, and the owner is a suspect in a fraud case. The investigator wants to recover WhatsApp messages, photos, call logs, and any deleted content.

### 🧰 Prerequisites:

* UFED 4PC or Touch2 device
* Latest UFED software updates
* Physical Analyzer installed
* Legal authority (e.g., search warrant)
* USB-C data cable
* SIM removal tool (optional)
* Forensic gloves and Faraday bag (to prevent remote wiping)

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Process

#### 🔹 1. **Setup and Preparation**

* Device is placed into **Airplane mode** or isolated in a **Faraday enclosure**.
* The phone is connected to UFED via USB-C.
* UFED launches and begins identifying the phone model and OS version.

#### 🔹 2. **Device Profiling**

UFED reports:

```bash
Device: Samsung Galaxy S10
OS: Android 10
Bootloader: Locked
Encryption: Full-disk (FDE)
Security Patch: April 2020
Status: Locked
```

UFED suggests:

* “Use **Custom Recovery Mode** for file system extraction.”
* “Rooting required for full access.”

#### 🔹 3. **Lock Bypass / Rooting**

* Investigator chooses **non-destructive bootloader exploit** available for this model.
* UFED boots into **custom recovery** mode temporarily.
* Data is accessed without altering user data.

> 🔐 No permanent rooting = better forensic soundness.

#### 🔹 4. **Data Extraction Begins**

* Logical and file system data are copied.
* WhatsApp database (`msgstore.db.crypt12`) and media folders are extracted.
* System logs, SMS, contacts, and photos are pulled.
* Deleted photos from `/DCIM/.thumbnails` and SQLite records are also found.

Extraction Summary:

```plaintext
Call logs: 110
SMS: 73
WhatsApp chats: 14,301
Photos/Videos: 2,512
Deleted artifacts: 342 recovered
Total time: 27 minutes
```

#### 🔹 5. **Data Parsing and Analysis**

Using **Cellebrite Physical Analyzer**:

* Investigators search keywords like “transfer,” “money,” and “fraud.”
* WhatsApp conversations with timestamps are reconstructed.
* Deleted messages are partially recovered via slack space in SQLite databases.
* Location history plotted using EXIF data + Google Maps cache.

#### 🔹 6. **Report Generation**

A report is exported in **PDF + Cellebrite Reader format** with:

* Case number
* Extracted evidence
* MD5/SHA-256 hashes
* Examiner name
* Timestamps
* Chat threads and images

This report can now be used in court or further criminal investigation.
