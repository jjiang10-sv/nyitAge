# News Feed System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a scalable news feed system designed to handle 100 million users with high-volume content creation and consumption patterns. The system must efficiently manage user subscriptions, content distribution, and personalized feed generation while maintaining performance at scale.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Management and Authentication

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to create an account and authenticate securely so that I can access personalized content and maintain my social connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a unique user account with profile information
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL verify credentials and establish a secure session
3. WHEN the system reaches 100M users THEN it SHALL maintain sub-second authentication response times
4. IF a user account is inactive for 2+ years THEN the system SHALL archive the account to optimize storage

### Requirement 2: Content Creation and Storage

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to publish posts up to 1KB in length so that I can share thoughts and updates with my subscribers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a post THEN the system SHALL accept text content up to 1024 characters
2. WHEN a post is submitted THEN the system SHALL store it with timestamp and author metadata
3. WHEN the system processes 100M posts per day THEN it SHALL maintain write latency under 100ms p95
4. IF a post contains prohibited content THEN the system SHALL reject it and notify the user
5. WHEN a user deletes a post THEN the system SHALL soft-delete it and remove from active feeds within 5 minutes

### Requirement 3: Subscription Management

**User Story:** As a social media user, I want to follow other users so that I can see their content in my personalized feed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user follows another user THEN the system SHALL create a subscription relationship
2. WHEN a user unfollows someone THEN the system SHALL remove the subscription and stop delivering their content
3. WHEN the system has 1B total follow relationships THEN it SHALL support follow/unfollow operations in under 50ms
4. IF a user tries to follow more than 10,000 accounts THEN the system SHALL enforce the limit and provide feedback
5. WHEN a celebrity user gains 100M followers THEN the system SHALL handle the fanout efficiently without degrading performance

### Requirement 4: Feed Generation and Ranking

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want to see the top 10 most relevant posts from users I follow so that I can stay updated with the most important content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their feed THEN the system SHALL return the top 10 posts from followed users
2. WHEN ranking posts THEN the system SHALL consider recency, engagement, and user affinity
3. WHEN a user has been inactive THEN the system SHALL show posts from their subscription period onward
4. IF no posts are available from followed users THEN the system SHALL return an empty feed with appropriate messaging
5. WHEN generating feeds for 20M daily active users THEN the system SHALL maintain p95 latency under 200ms

### Requirement 5: Real-time Content Distribution

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see new posts from people I follow appear in my feed quickly so that I can engage with fresh content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a followed user publishes a post THEN it SHALL appear in subscribers' feeds within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a celebrity posts content THEN the system SHALL distribute it to 100M followers without system overload
3. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade by delaying non-critical updates
4. IF the fanout system fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to pull-based feed generation
5. WHEN a user opens their feed THEN they SHALL see content posted since their last visit

### Requirement 6: System Scalability and Performance

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to handle 100M users with consistent performance so that user experience remains excellent at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system serves 100M users THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime
2. WHEN handling peak traffic (10x normal load) THEN the system SHALL auto-scale resources within 2 minutes
3. WHEN storing 100M posts daily THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage storage growth and costs
4. IF any single component fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with degraded functionality
5. WHEN monitoring system health THEN operators SHALL receive alerts for any performance degradation

### Requirement 7: Data Consistency and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want my posts and subscriptions to be reliably stored and consistently visible so that I don't lose content or connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user publishes a post THEN it SHALL be durably stored with 99.999% reliability
2. WHEN subscription changes occur THEN they SHALL be eventually consistent across all system components within 1 minute
3. WHEN the system performs maintenance THEN user data SHALL remain accessible and consistent
4. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically recover from backups
5. WHEN users access their data from different regions THEN they SHALL see consistent information

### Requirement 8: Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my data to be secure and my privacy settings respected so that I can control who sees my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets their account to private THEN only approved followers SHALL see their posts
2. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information at rest and in transit
3. WHEN a user blocks another user THEN the blocked user SHALL not see the blocker's content or be able to follow them
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL temporarily restrict the account and notify the user
5. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all personal data within 30 days

### Requirement 9: Analytics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive system metrics and user analytics so that I can optimize performance and understand usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN the platform SHALL track key metrics (latency, throughput, error rates)
2. WHEN analyzing user behavior THEN the system SHALL provide engagement metrics while respecting privacy
3. WHEN system anomalies occur THEN operators SHALL be alerted within 1 minute
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically capture diagnostic information
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on content trends and user growth

### Requirement 10: Content Moderation and Safety

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to be protected from harmful content so that I can have a safe and positive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is posted THEN the system SHALL scan for prohibited material using automated tools
2. WHEN harmful content is detected THEN it SHALL be removed and the author notified within 15 minutes
3. WHEN users report content THEN moderators SHALL review it within 24 hours
4. IF a user repeatedly violates policies THEN the system SHALL escalate enforcement actions
5. WHEN content is moderated THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs for compliance
