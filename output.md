Business Impact Assessment

Agriculture – Bolthouse Farms


Safeguarding Agribusiness Operations

Our focus: ensuring resilience in the production and distribution of fresh carrots and plant-based beverages for Bolthouse Farms.

Fresh Carrots

From field to packaging, maintaining optimal quality and freshness.

Plant-Based Beverages

Ensuring consistent production and supply of healthy drinks.

Key vulnerabilities identified include cold storage, irrigation systems, and enterprise resource planning (ERP)/warehouse management systems (WMS). Our ultimate goal is to protect continuity, food safety, and customer supply.

Operational Flow: From Farm to Table

A seamless chain of critical functions ensures the delivery of high-quality products.

Farm Operations

Irrigation &amp; field management are paramount for crop health.

Washing &amp; Packaging

Initial processing for cleanliness and preparation.

Cold Storage

Temperature-controlled environment for product preservation.

Beverage Processing

Juice extraction, blending, and bottling lines.

Distribution

Efficient logistics to deliver fresh products to customers.

Pillars of Success: Critical Factors &amp; Systems

Critical Success Factors

Temperature Stability

Maintaining optimal cold chain integrity.

Daily Processing Output

Meeting production targets consistently.

Order Fulfillment Rate

Ensuring timely and accurate delivery.

Irrigation Consistency

Reliable water supply for crop health.

Food Safety Compliance

Adhering to strict regulatory standards.

Critical Systems

Cold Storage Control

Advanced systems for temperature regulation.

Beverage Processing

Automated lines for efficiency and quality.

Irrigation Automation

Smart systems for efficient water distribution.

ERP/WMS Integration

Centralized management for operations.

Transportation Scheduling

Optimized logistics for timely deliveries.

Maximum Allowable Outage (MAO): Understanding the Risks

Identifying critical downtime thresholds and their potential impacts on operations.

Cold Storage

2 hours: Immediate produce spoilage and significant waste.

Beverage Processing Line

4 hours: Production delays, leading to missed orders and revenue loss.

Irrigation System

6 hours: Severe crop health risks, especially during peak heat periods.

ERP/WMS

4 hours: Disruptions in order processing and inventory management.

Distribution &amp; Transport

12 hours: Retail stockouts, damaging brand reputation and sales.

Each critical system has an MAO defining the 

point at which an outage becomes unacceptable.

Fortifying Operations: Comprehensive Risk Mitigation

Proactive strategies to safeguard against operational disruptions and ensure business continuity.

Cold Storage

Redundant refrigeration, continuous monitoring, and backup generators.

Processing Lines

Rigorous preventive maintenance, readily available spare parts, 

and on-call technicians.

Irrigation

Backup pumps, secondary water supply sources, 

and manual contingency plans.

Supply Chain

Alternative trucking routes, geographically distributed 

warehouses, and ERP cloud backups.

Food Safety

Adherence to HACCP/FDA audits, and redundant testing 

equipment to ensure compliance.

These integrated strategies are designed to minimize risks and ensure uninterrupted supply.
